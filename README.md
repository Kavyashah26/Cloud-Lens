# üõ†Ô∏è Cloud Resource Monitoring and Notification System

This application helps AWS users monitor their cloud resources and receive notifications when certain thresholds are breached. The system supports AWS services like EC2, S3, and RDS, allowing users to set up jobs that automatically check for overuse or underuse of their resources. Users can receive notifications via email, SMS, or webhook integrations.

## üöÄ Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT authentication.
- **Monitor AWS Resources**: Set up jobs to monitor AWS EC2, S3, and RDS resources.
- **Threshold-Based Alerts**: Define thresholds for resource utilization and get alerts when these limits are crossed.
- **Multi-Channel Notifications**: Receive alerts via:
  - **Email** (Node mailer)
  - **SMS** (Twilio integration)
  - **Webhooks** (User-defined URL to trigger external services)
- **Job Scheduling**: Periodically check your resources using background jobs and cron-like scheduling.
- **Dashboard**: View, create, and manage all jobs linked to your account.

## üñ•Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
- **Cloud Services**: AWS SDK (EC2, S3, RDS), Twilio for SMS
- **Notifications**: Nodemailer (SMTP support), Twilio, Webhooks
- **Hosting**: Vercel (for frontend) or EC2 (for full-stack deployment)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
